# Jojoposes


so basically what this program does that it looks at a pose someone does in a photograph and then the program tries its best to identify which jojo pose that the subject is doing.
I am able to accompish this with the following open sources

https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
https://pypi.org/project/imutils/
https://numpy.org/
